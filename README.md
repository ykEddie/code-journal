Goal: Update "website" and push it to GitHub
Getting a login problem, not exactly sure what's wrong. A little frustrated ngl.
Adding and committing is getting etched into my memory now, just need to figure out this push problem
- Tried to push to git for the first time
- Having a few problems
- Might need to set up SSH keys
- Set up SSH key but still unable to push lol
- Used trusty ol' Google to figure out how to change it from HTTPS to SSH so I can finally push
## January 13th pt. 2
- Git collaboration with a partner
- made a new repo and invited Jason to be a contributor
- had a little trouble pushing a static html template to git bash/VS code
- finally started playing "commit catch" with partner
After a couple back and forth commits we created a merge conflict by working on the same line of code and having one person try to push without pulling first.
- Commit catch is actually kinda fun lol
## January 14th
Not doing anything too crazy today
Goal: embed an image into a markdown
- learned some stuff about copyright and licenses
- forgot how to do that so I'll watch the recording again
- Had a guest speaker come in and talk about how she got through the class
- had UX explained a little bit
## January 17th
Goal get sort of comfortable with UX I guess
- Learned about user stories and how to make a good one
- Tony explained gists but I think I'm gonna stick to making repos the first way I learned
- Wrote down some user flow scenarios in my notebook, will enter them into a markdown for assignment 
- [Read a little bit about wireframes](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/what-are-user-flows/)
- Tried drawing a wireframe by hand that matched one of my user flow scenarios

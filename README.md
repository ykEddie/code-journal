Goal: Update "website" and push it to GitHub
Getting a login problem, not exactly sure what's wrong. A little frustrated ngl.
Adding and committing is getting etched into my memory now, just need to figure out this push problem
- Tried to push to git for the first time
- Having a few problems
- Might need to set up SSH keys
- Set up SSH key but still unable to push lol
- Used trusty ol' Google to figure out how to change it from HTTPS to SSH so I can finally push
## January 13th pt. 2
- Git collaboration with a partner
- made a new repo and invited Jason to be a contributor
- had a little trouble pushing a static html template to git bash/VS code
- finally started playing "commit catch" with partner
After a couple back and forth commits we created a merge conflict by working on the same line of code and having one person try to push without pulling first.
- Commit catch is actually kinda fun lol
## January 14th
Not doing anything too crazy today
Goal: embed an image into a markdown
- learned some stuff about copyright and licenses
- forgot how to do that so I'll watch the recording again
- Had a guest speaker come in and talk about how she got through the class
- had UX explained a little bit
## January 17th
Goal get sort of comfortable with UX I guess
- Learned about user stories and how to make a good one
- Tony explained gists but I think I'm gonna stick to making repos the first way I learned
- Wrote down some user flow scenarios in my notebook, will enter them into a markdown for assignment 
- [Read a little bit about wireframes](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/what-are-user-flows/)
- Tried drawing a wireframe by hand that matched one of my user flow scenarios 
- Looked through the markdown cheat sheet found this code `![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 1")`

**Picture didn't show up how I wanted or expected, will ask Tony next time about how to fix the problem**

Goal: Work on Dsgn270 assignment 1
- Started creating a wireflow on Figma not going so well
- Not sure how to get icons from Font Awesome into Figma
- Finished most of the content for assignment, just trying to figure out how to make this wireflow
- This is not working, might have to draw it by hand if I can't figure it out
## January 19th 
Goal: Finish Dsgn270 assignment 1

 Watched the video on [reading hex color codes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqZqx6lRPe0) that stuff makes a lot of sense now
- Did a bunch of practice with read hex codes, getting the hang of it but still gotta remember most of the line graph shapes so I actually know what the hue/colour is
- So I finally figured out how to get icons into Figma with Tony's help
    - This site has plugins and downloads for a lot of icons useful in making wireflows and websites: [UIPrep](https://www.uiprep.com/blog/ultimate-guide-to-using-icons-in-figma#:~:text=Add%20icons%20to%20your%20Figma,a%20plugin%20(most%20recommended).)
- Making the wireflow screens was very hard for some reason, took me a few hours
- Having to zoom in every single time to find an icon I just added was really annoying

Good news, finished wireflow half of the assignment now I just need to figure out how to get that downloaded picture into my markdown.

## January 20th
Goal: Finish CPNT260 Wiki Article

Ash explained the basics of HTML and CSS on CodePen so that was really helpful
- Made my own replica of a [One Piece article from wikipedia](https://codepen.io/ykeddie/pen/jOGjGMM)
- I think I'm starting to get the hang of HTML and CSS, definitely going to have to practice a lot more
- Figuring out how to fix all the dimensions for pictures and borders etc. is surprisingly difficult
- The [video on hex code colours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqZqx6lRPe0) was really useful cause I was able to actually make the background of a box a specific color/shade rather than just typing in "red" or "blue"
- My codepen assignment honestly isn't the best but I'm sure with practice I'll be able to improve
- Need to learn how to shift the whole paragraph to the middle (would've made it look nicer before handing in)

Was able to finish Wiki Article, gonna start on my other assignment

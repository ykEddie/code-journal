Goal: Update "website" and push it to GitHub
Getting a login problem, not exactly sure what's wrong. A little frustrated ngl
Adding and committing is getting etched into my memory now, just need to figure out this push problem
- Tried to push to git for the first time
- Having a few problems
- Might need to set up SSH keys
- Set up SSH key but still unable to push lol
